A winter ago, I joined the magnificence known as SDSLabs only to be greeted by the dawning fact of how less I knew. The immense knowledge out there was something that had bewitched me, and the only thing that I wanted any more was to be a part of them. Hence starts my journey at SDSLabs. So let's travel the road together, shall we?

The first couple of months passed while learning through extensive (believe me it's an understatement) lectures. Each of these lectures, taken by our seniors, of course, covered the various basic but crucial fundamentals(including good developmental practices) such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Git/Bash to name a few. Following the lectures came the assignments. For many of us first-years, including me, it was the first time trying to develop a complex application with a fixed timeline(reminds of industries right). These assignments were judged critically to make us aware of the mistakes and also to make us familiar with better ways to write code.

After we were done with all the lectures, next in line were our minor projects. These were issues on some of our applications that needed addressing. This was our first time working on a project which wasn't our own(in other words contributing similarly to an open-source project). We got acquainted with the pre-existing code, and with the help of our mentors, started working on our minors(GSoC vibes).

Then came the big day, the day when we were assigned our major projects. Everyone was assigned work-intensive tasks that were to be completed in the summers. These major projects were, in actuality, the culmination of all our preparations until now. All the work that we had done so passionately until now all led to this. Our majors are something we take pride to date. Following the successful completion of our majors, we were assigned other tasks. We have now finally become full-fledged members of the coding community, ready to contribute to various projects all around. Back to the present, and here we are.

As a final note, all these activities were laced and intertwined with a series of chapos and fun activities. But above all were the bonds made with a new family.
