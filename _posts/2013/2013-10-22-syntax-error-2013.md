SDSLabs organized IIT Roorkee's 1st hackathon, Syntax Error, on 19-20 October, 2013. It was a [Google Cloud Developer Challenge](https://www.google.com/events/gcdc2013/) promotional event and saw great response from the geeks of IITR. Here are a few numbers: 150+ registrations, 101 participants, &lt; 24 hours, 36 hacks, 491 commits, 1029325 lines of code. Participants were spread across all years (Yes, we had teams from 1st year as well) and branches. This was also the 1st time GitHub supported an Indian university in organizing a hackathon.

The event was kicked off with a talk on Google App Engine by Rohit Gupta & [Anudeep Sai](https://plus.google.com/u/0/117456238851648091666), Google. The session lasted almost an hour and the Googlers covered various verticals of the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) and went on to talk about the Google Cloud Developer Challenge. This was followed by a Git classroom hangout by [Jordan McCullough](https://github.com/blog/1456-jordan-mccullough-is-a-githubber), [GitHub](https://github.com/jordanmccullough). It was an extremely thorough session. Jordan started right from the basics and went on to advanced topics. Soon after, Abhishek Das, Google Student Ambassador IITR, introduced the participants to the format of the event and explained the [rules and judging criteria](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yXJ6h4QqfKYbEE1yIweVjEV0ZmGcknrnLarOocOaB64/edit?usp=sharing).
