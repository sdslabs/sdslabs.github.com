We recruit students every year during the winters and select the best minds from the IITR Junta to join our venture for leading the technological innovation in the IIT Roorkee campus.

We are open to all years of students of IITR to apply in our recruitment drive. However, the majority of our recruits are in their 1st year of study.

# Recruitment Process

We provide you with five different methods of landing an interview at SDSLabs during the Recruitment Drive. These methods are:

* Placing amongst selected teams at the SDSLabs' Syntax Error Hackathon 2019
* Completing SDSLabs' Winter of Code 2019
* Completing SDSlabs' Makers 2020
* Placing amongst the top students at any of our competitions mentioned below
* Placing amongst the top students in SDS' Recruitment Test and Design problem statement submissions

## Syntax Error

We call students for an interview who placed in the top 2 first-year-only teams and the top second-year-only team at Syntax Error.

Since the hackathon winners have already been announced, the respective teams will be called during the interview process.

## Winter of Code 2019

Students who were selected for SDSLabs' Winter of Code 2019 and were able to pass all their evaluations successfully will be invited for an interview at SDSLabs during the interview process.

## Makers 2020

Students who developed on a project idea released during Makers 2020 or developed on their own project idea of a similar caliber will be invited for an interview at SDSLabs during the interview process.

## Competitions

SDS organizes a variety of competitions for the 1st year junta at IIT Roorkee during the winters. We like to call the Top 2 students from each of these competitions for an interview:
* NoobCTF
  * Capture the flag competition 
  * Hosted at [Backdoor](backdoor.sdslabs.co) with InfoSec IITR
* Beginner's Hypothesis
  * Data Science competition 
  * Hosted at [Cerebro](cerebro.sdslabs.co) with DSG IITR
* Algophobic
  * Competitive programming competition
  * Hosted at [Codevillage](codevillage.sdslabs.co) with PAG IITR
* Endgame
  * Mathematical problem-solving competition
  * Hosted at [Erd≈ës](erdos.sdslabs.co)

## Recruitment Test and Design Problem statements

SDS' recruitment test has various sections, including logical reasoning, competitive programming, probability, and web development (HTML/CSS/JS).

We invite the top scores from individual sections and the top scorers overall for an interview during the interview process. Needless to say, the evaluation will be done based on your performance in individual sections.

Design based problem statements will be released during the recruitment test your skills in various fields of design like UI/UX and graphic design. Design submissions will be considered for recruiting into SDSLabs as a designer.

Apart from all these methods, we are yearly open to wildcard entries. If you somehow are not able to make it this time, you can reach out to us at contact@sdslabs.co.in with your CV after the Recruitment Drive.

We hope we have made the entire recruitment process clear for all the enthusiasts out there. We look forward to seeing you test your skills at our Recruitment Drive this winter.

Best of luck!
