## Before labs

Like most of the people after JEE, I too didn't know much about computers and art of development, though i was curious enough to explore it. After coming to IIT Roorkee starting from the ice-breaker session with the seniors, we have been regularly told  to explore various fields and make use of opportunities available to us at IITR . So, i started with HTML and CSS after getting into NSS technocreative Web-d cell, as I had learnt it somewhat in the CBSE 10 class. Apart from that, I was able to learn java in my OOPS course.

From beginning SDSLabs was continually organising various competitions on erdos, code village and backdoor. Through those, i got to know about Labs and become more interested in software development. And in winter break, I decided to look into full-stack development  and get in SDSLabs.

## Entry to SDSLabs

I still remember, it was the last day of labs' interview, clock stroke 2 oâ€™ clock and list of selected members was to be declared by the day end and i hadn't got any call <span style="color:grey">(inner me , _"bhai ka fir kat gya"_)</span>. Though i decided to give it one last shot, called some senior and found out due to some name confusion, my name was stuck off even before calling. They asked me to come in 5 mins and took my interview, it being more or less discussion, to my enjoyment (and to my relief) they were asking about my point of view on certain problems <span style="color:grey">(to 1st yearites, _so don't worry fellows_)</span> and in the  list declared two hours later my name was __THERE__.<span style="color:grey">(inner me, _"bhai kisi se kam he kya"_)</span>.

## Journey Begins

On my first time entering labs, the thing that caught my sight was the achievement of labs members hanging all over the walls <span style="color:grey">(inner me, _"woh!! ek din bhai ki bhi tasveer latkegi"_)</span> and then the color behind it, pink !!(must  have an  interesting history). Hospitable environment intrigued me the most, and  thinking about chances and opportunity i would get here, i was more than satisfied. SDSLabs expect us to be a complete beginner, lecture on various topics ranging from html css to networking to current blooming fields like bitcoins and blockchain are held, and scrutiny over these is even more valuable. Projects also help in regularly applying it. During that time in february, microsoft organised "code.fun.do" my first hackathon, with some help of senior and sleepless night, a full blown application was ready. That encounter with new technologies , developing application and it's delivering was astounding.

Labs is at its peak when most of the members are there, that makes the  whole atmosphere  very energetic, and the bombarding of knowledge makes u stay without realizing time. Often i had to return at 2-3 o'clock (and fellows, its A.M.) and sometimes even spent the night over there. One of my favorite nights is when we conducted the internal hackathon to develop some of our own applications, get to work in team and that trifling competition, including the most entertaining part  of flying kira's drone.

Often we fight for most time spent and activity in labs as somethings are worth fighting for. Sometimes, gyan sessions from seniors  are necessary for making ourselves motivated. Resources and direction provided by them helps in making the best use of time. Following reddit, hackernews and medium has become a part of my daily routine. Without even realising, I have gaining so much from labs each day that such progress couldn't be possible anywhere else ( and I Mean Genuinely).

## Fun and Trip

Whenever someone does something great, it meant a time for chapo. Every group in IITR has chapos but the frequency and level with which SDSLabs has, are __UNMATCHED__. We also have an annual trip, last year it was to rishikesh. Packed with tracking, camping and rafting, along with a lot of fun  it was a complete package. Playing mafia, sharing our life experience, listening to others and late night horror stories made it more memorable. Next day, rafting and cliff jumping added thrill to it.


Last year that I  spent here has taught me so much, fun and entertainment helped in easing this process and kept me motivated.

## Recruitments

We are going to have recruitments within the first half of january and we will be looking for some of the best of  curious and energetic minds of the younger IITR junta. These recruitments are a way of knowing our juniors and letting them know about us.

Waiting eagerly for you. <span style="color:grey">(inner me, _"aaye aapka intezaar hai"_)</span>.
