title: Filepanda and Live Streaming
excerpt: What's new at SDSLabs
---

We've been busy here at SDSLabs. The last week was marked by two new launches. Filepanda was launched on the internet  on the 6th and live streaming on the sdslabs portal was launched on the 13th. 

## Filepanda

Filepanda is now on the internet. It can be accessed at <https://filepanda.sdslabs.co>. from any computer outside the campus.  
Filepanda is the SDSLabs self updating software repository. 'Self Updating' because it's just that.  
Filepanda automatically updates itself. Every piece of software on filepanda is the always the latest version. So next time you find yourself in need of an anti virus or a new media player, a quick search through the repository should give you the goods.

## Live Streaming

Tired of going to the TV room or UG Club to watch Sachin bat? Wanna grab the united game right from your room? Well we hear you. SDSLabs launches live streaming using which you can grab any live action from the comfort(well somewhat :P) of your hostel room. 

Live streaming can be accessed at <https://sdslabs.co.in/live/>.
