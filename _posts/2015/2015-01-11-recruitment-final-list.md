title: Final Recruitment List For 1st year (2015)
excerpt: Recruitment results 2015.
---

We interviewed 75 people before releasing the final list of selected people. It was a really tough job to filter down from the talented applicants to the final list. Sadly, we have limited vacancies and can only take in a limited number. But this is not the end of line for others, there's still a way to [join SDSLabs](/2014/01/how-to-join-sdslabs/). We'll continue taking open lectures on variety of topics. Stay connected with us on our Facebook [page](http://facebook.com/sdslabs) and [group](http://facebook.com/groups/sdswebdev) for the updates regarding this.
